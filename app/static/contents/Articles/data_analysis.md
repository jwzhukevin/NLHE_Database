# Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

## Overview

This article covers advanced techniques for analyzing material data in our database. These methods can help researchers extract meaningful insights from the available datasets.

## Statistical Analysis

### Correlation Studies

Identifying correlations between different material properties can lead to new discoveries:

```
correlation_matrix = df[['gap', 'workfunction', 'formation_energy']].corr()
```

### Clustering Analysis

Grouping materials with similar properties:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(normalized_data)
```

## Machine Learning Applications

### Property Prediction

Training models to predict material properties:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Structure-Property Relationships

Using deep learning to understand relationships between atomic structure and properties:

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv3D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    MaxPooling3D(pool_size=2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])
```

## Visualization Techniques

### 3D Property Mapping

Visualize materials in a 3D space defined by their properties:

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
scatter = ax.scatter(x, y, z, c=colors, s=sizes)
```

### Interactive Dashboards

Create dashboards for interactive exploration:

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter_3d(df, x='gap', y='formation_energy', z='workfunction',
                   color='metal_type', hover_name='name')
```

## Conclusion

Advanced data analysis techniques allow researchers to extract maximum value from the materials database, potentially leading to new discoveries and insights in materials science.
